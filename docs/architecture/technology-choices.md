# Key Technology Choices & Rationale

This document outlines the key technology choices made for the Blockchain-DApp project and the rationale behind each decision.

## Frontend Technologies

### React + React Native
**Choice**: Single stack JavaScript/TypeScript for both web and mobile UI development.

**Rationale**:
- **Code Reusability**: Significant portions of the UI logic and components can be shared between web and mobile platforms, reducing development time and maintenance overhead.
- **Unified Skill Set**: Developers can work on both web and mobile applications with the same core skill set, improving team efficiency.
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: Both React and React Native have mature ecosystems with extensive libraries, tools, and community support.
- **Performance**: React Native provides near-native performance for mobile applications while React offers excellent performance for web applications.
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent development tooling, hot reloading, and debugging capabilities.

## Backend Technologies

### Golang
**Choice**: Golang as the primary backend language.

**Rationale**:
- **Concurrency**: Excellent built-in concurrency support with goroutines and channels, essential for handling multiple blockchain operations simultaneously.
- **Performance**: Compiled language with excellent performance characteristics, crucial for blockchain operations that require low latency.
- **Simplicity**: Clean, simple syntax that reduces development time and improves code maintainability.
- **Ecosystem**: Mature ecosystem with excellent libraries for blockchain development, web services, and database interactions.
- **Deployment**: Single binary deployment simplifies operations and reduces runtime dependencies.

### PostgreSQL
**Choice**: PostgreSQL as the primary database.

**Rationale**:
- **ACID Compliance**: Essential for financial ledger entries where data integrity is critical.
- **Relational Queries**: Powerful SQL capabilities for complex queries and reporting requirements.
- **JSON Support**: Native JSON support for flexible data modeling when needed.
- **Maturity**: Proven, stable database with excellent performance and reliability.
- **Scalability**: Good horizontal and vertical scaling options.

## Infrastructure Technologies

### EKS (Kubernetes)
**Choice**: Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service for container orchestration.

**Rationale**:
- **Advanced Control**: Fine-grained control over containerized applications and infrastructure.
- **Scaling**: Automatic scaling capabilities to handle varying loads.
- **Industry Standard**: Widely adopted standard for container orchestration with extensive tooling and expertise.
- **High Availability**: Built-in high availability features for production workloads.
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of tools and services that integrate well with Kubernetes.

### Terraform
**Choice**: Terraform for infrastructure as code.

**Rationale**:
- **Reproducibility**: Infrastructure can be consistently reproduced across environments.
- **Modularity**: Ability to create reusable modules for different environments (dev, staging, prod).
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure changes can be tracked, reviewed, and rolled back like application code.
- **Multi-Cloud**: Vendor-neutral approach allows for potential multi-cloud deployments in the future.
- **State Management**: Robust state management for tracking infrastructure changes.

## Payment and Card Technologies

### Stripe Issuing / Marqeta
**Choice**: Third-party card issuing providers rather than building in-house solutions.

**Rationale**:
- **Reduced Complexity**: Avoids building complex network integrations in-house, which would require significant time and expertise.
- **Push-to-Wallet**: Both providers offer push-to-wallet functionality (Apple Pay, Google Pay) out of the box.
- **Tokenization**: Built-in tokenization services for secure card transactions.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Both providers handle complex regulatory requirements for card issuing.
- **Time to Market**: Significantly faster implementation compared to building from scratch.
- **Cost-Effective**: More economical than building and maintaining an in-house card issuing infrastructure.

## Observability Stack

### Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager
**Choice**: Established observability stack for monitoring and alerting.

**Rationale**:
- **Industry Standard**: Widely adopted stack with extensive community support and documentation.
- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus excels at metrics collection and time-series data storage.
- **Visualization**: Grafana provides powerful visualization capabilities with customizable dashboards.
- **Alerting**: Alertmanager offers sophisticated alerting capabilities with deduplication and grouping.
- **Integration**: Excellent integration with Kubernetes and other cloud-native technologies.
- **Flexibility**: Highly configurable and extensible to meet specific monitoring needs.

## CI/CD Technologies

### GitHub Actions
**Choice**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

**Rationale**:
- **Native Integration**: Seamless integration with GitHub repositories where the code is already hosted.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple YAML-based workflow configuration.
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales based on workload without additional infrastructure management.
- **Security**: Built-in security features and secrets management.
- **Ecosystem**: Extensive marketplace of actions for common tasks.
- **Cost-Effective**: No additional cost for basic usage within GitHub's free tier limits.
